Today I had changed the username of my github account
the old one was RambabuPatidar but the problem happning with it 
when i am using it to use my github page. 
It looks something like RambabuPatidar.github.io
and the browser never accepts the capital letter words in urls and it was automatically getting converted to small in url
so there is confution started happing that should I enter rambabupatidar.github.io to goto my page 
or RambabuPatidar.github.io so i changed the username to rambabu-patidar now 
I had done it early thanks to myself other wise after doing so many work on github and then changing usename is 
not a good practice. other wise many link that were pointing to previous will not points to 404 error.
